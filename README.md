# SK-PHP_SELECTOR WITH MEMCACHED
phpXX-pecl-memcached phpXX-pecl-memcache

# sk-php-selector
PHP selector for centos 6/7 

# RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK

This install php 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4alpha in your centos 6 and centos 7

**Use sk-php-selector2.sh, in this you can select what php version install
sk-php-selector3.sh is same as sk-php-selector2.sh but with simplified code, now in testing **

# So you can select just one version runing it as:

bash sk-php-selector2.sh php72

# Or install multiple version

bash sk-php-selector2.sh php56 php71

# or install all

bash sk-php-selector2.sh all

This works fine, the configuration of php need some work so try firts in test enviroment

------------

This can break phpmyadmin, in this case you need delete some mod_php files in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ you can move out all php??.conf just leave php.conf ( not delete maybe you need restore it )

This is aleatory and need more debugin, not always was broken so I cant say you exactly, but the solution is wasy
